# Search & Filtering Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of comprehensive search and filtering functionality for the saved articles screen in ReadSoon. The system provides real-time search, advanced filtering options, and search history management.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Real-time Search
- **Instant Search**: Search as you type with real-time filtering
- **Multi-field Search**: Searches across title, description, content, and source
- **Case-insensitive**: Search queries are case-insensitive for better user experience

### 2. Advanced Filtering
- **Date Range**: Filter by today, this week, this month, this year, or all time
- **Sources**: Filter by specific websites/sources
- **Reading Time**: Filter by quick read (< 5 min), medium (5-15 min), or long read (> 15 min)
- **Tags**: Filter by custom tags or auto-extracted tags from content
- **Favorites**: Show only favorited articles
- **Content**: Show only articles with full content

### 3. Search History
- **Automatic Storage**: Search queries are automatically saved
- **Quick Access**: Tap on recent searches to quickly repeat them
- **Persistent**: Search history persists across app sessions
- **Clear History**: Option to clear all search history

### 4. Filter Modal
- **Comprehensive UI**: Full-screen modal with all filter options
- **Visual Feedback**: Active filters are highlighted
- **Clear All**: Option to reset all filters at once
- **Apply/Cancel**: Clear actions for applying or canceling changes

## Technical Implementation

### Components

#### SearchBar (`components/saved/SearchBar.tsx`)
- Clean, modern search input with clear button
- Filter button with active state indicator
- Responsive design with proper theming

#### FilterModal (`components/saved/FilterModal.tsx`)
- Full-screen modal with comprehensive filter options
- Date range selection with predefined options
- Source selection from available sources
- Reading time categorization
- Tag management with custom tag input
- Toggle switches for boolean filters

#### SearchHistory (`components/saved/SearchHistory.tsx`)
- Displays recent search queries
- Tap to select previous searches
- Clear all history option
- Conditional rendering based on visibility state

### Hook: useSearchAndFilter

The main logic is encapsulated in a custom hook that provides:

```typescript
const {
    // State
    searchQuery,
    filters,
    searchHistory,
    isFilterModalVisible,
    filteredArticles,
    availableSources,
    availableTags,
    isFilterActive,

    // Actions
    handleSearch,
    clearSearch,
    handleFilterPress,
    handleApplyFilters,
    clearFilters,
    setIsFilterModalVisible,
    addToSearchHistory,
    clearSearchHistory,
} = useSearchAndFilter(articles);
```

### Filter Options Interface

```typescript
interface FilterOptions {
    dateRange: 'all' | 'today' | 'week' | 'month' | 'year';
    sources: string[];
    readingTime: 'all' | 'quick' | 'medium' | 'long';
    tags: string[];
    favoritesOnly: boolean;
    hasContent: boolean;
}
```

### Storage Integration

Search history is stored securely using `expo-secure-store`:

```typescript
// Store search history
await StorageHelpers.setSearchHistory(history);

// Retrieve search history
const history = await StorageHelpers.getSearchHistory();

// Clear search history
await StorageHelpers.clearSearchHistory();
```

## User Experience

### Search Flow
1. User taps on search bar
2. Search history appears (if available)
3. User can type to search or select from history
4. Results update in real-time
5. Search query is automatically saved to history

### Filter Flow
1. User taps filter button
2. Filter modal opens with current filter state
3. User adjusts filters as needed
4. User taps "Apply Filters" to confirm
5. Results update based on new filters
6. Filter button shows active state if filters are applied

### Empty States
- **No Articles**: Shows default empty state for new users
- **No Search Results**: Shows search-specific empty state with suggestions
- **No Filter Results**: Shows filter-specific empty state

## Performance Considerations

### Client-side Filtering
- Most filtering is done client-side for instant results
- Only database queries for date range and basic filters
- Efficient memoization using `useMemo` for expensive operations

### Search History Management
- Limited to 10 recent searches to prevent storage bloat
- Automatic deduplication of search queries
- Secure storage with encryption

### Available Data Extraction
- Sources are extracted from article URLs
- Tags are extracted from article content (simple word-based approach)
- Reading time is calculated from content length

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Server-side Search**: Implement full-text search on the backend
2. **Smart Tags**: Use NLP to extract meaningful tags
3. **Search Suggestions**: Auto-complete based on existing content
4. **Advanced Filters**: Add more sophisticated filtering options
5. **Search Analytics**: Track popular searches and content

### Database Optimizations
1. **Full-text Search Index**: Add PostgreSQL full-text search capabilities
2. **Tag Storage**: Dedicated tags table for better tag management
3. **Reading Time Storage**: Store calculated reading time in database
4. **Source Normalization**: Better source extraction and storage

## Usage Examples

### Basic Search
```typescript
// User types "react native"
const results = articles.filter(article =>
    article.title.toLowerCase().includes('react native') ||
    article.description.toLowerCase().includes('react native')
);
```

### Date Filtering
```typescript
// Filter articles from this week
const weekAgo = new Date(now.getTime() - 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
const recentArticles = articles.filter(article =>
    new Date(article.savedAt) >= weekAgo
);
```

### Combined Filters
```typescript
// Search + Date + Source filtering
const filtered = articles
    .filter(article => article.title.includes(searchQuery))
    .filter(article => new Date(article.savedAt) >= weekAgo)
    .filter(article => filters.sources.includes(article.source));
```

## Testing

The implementation includes:
- Type safety with TypeScript
- Error handling for storage operations
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Theme support for light/dark modes

## Conclusion

The search and filtering system provides a comprehensive solution for users to find and organize their saved articles. The implementation is performant, user-friendly, and extensible for future enhancements.
